# probability-calculator

freecodecamp project

This program approximates the probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat. 

You will define:
1. expected_balls - the group of balls to attempt to be drawn from the hat.
2. num_balls_drawn - the number of balls that will be drawn from the hat.
3. num_experiements - the number of experiments to perform.

This will return a probability.
